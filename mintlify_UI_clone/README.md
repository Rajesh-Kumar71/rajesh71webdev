# Mintlify UI Clone – HTML & CSS Assignment

This repository contains a **desktop-first UI recreation** inspired by the public website **https://www.mintlify.com/**.  
The objective of this assignment was to closely match the **structure, layout, and visual hierarchy** of a modern documentation-style landing page using **only HTML and CSS**.

The focus is on **content structure, readability, and layout accuracy**, not interactivity or responsiveness.

## Constraints Followed

This project strictly adheres to the given constraints:

- Use only **HTML and CSS**
- No JavaScript
- No TailwindCSS
- No usage of AI(Help taken to search required TAG and its properties)
- No animations or fancy effects

## Special Note on Visuals

In some places, **static screenshots or images are used instead of recreating complex UI components purely in code**.  
This was done intentionally because:

- The assignment emphasizes **layout and structure**
- It helps maintain closer visual similarity without adding unnecessary complexity
