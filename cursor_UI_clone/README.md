This repository contains a **desktop-first documentation-style website** inspired by the structure and layout of **Cursor (https://www.cursor.com/)**.  
The project focuses on **content structure, readability, and layout accuracy**, rather than interactivity or responsiveness.

The goal of this assignment was to understand how a modern documentation landing page is organized using **semantic HTML and clean CSS**.

## Fonts and Colors Used

- **Fonts**
  - System fonts / sans-serif stack (similar to Cursor’s clean, modern typography)
  - Focus on readability and hierarchy using headings and spacing

- **Colors**
  - Dark text on light background for documentation clarity
  - Neutral grays for secondary text
  - Accent buttons and highlights inspired by the original design
  - Minimal use of borders and separators to maintain a clean layout

Exact color values were chosen to **closely resemble the original design**, without over-styling or visual effects.

## Special Note on Images & Screenshots

- In a few sections, **static screenshots/images are used instead of recreating complex UI components in code**.
- This decision was taken intentionally because:
  - Responsiveness was **not required**
  - The focus was on **layout structure and content placement**
  - It helps maintain visual similarity with the original website without adding unnecessary complexity
